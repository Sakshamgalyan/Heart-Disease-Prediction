# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
This project is a **Heart Disease Prediction System** that utilizes a **Logistic Regression Model** for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on medical parameters. The system includes a **Tkinter-based GUI** for user-friendly interaction.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Model:** Uses Logistic Regression for classification.
- **User Interface:** Developed with Tkinter for easy input and result visualization.
- **Data Processing:** Prepares and normalizes data for accurate predictions.
- **Real-time Prediction:** Instant result display upon entering input values.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Tkinter** (GUI Development)
- **scikit-learn** (ML Model)
- **pandas & numpy** (Data Handling)
- **matplotlib** (Visualization)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/heart-disease-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Enter patient details in the GUI.
3. Click the "Predict" button to get results.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a standard **Heart Disease Dataset** containing medical parameters such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Level
- Chest Pain Type
- Maximum Heart Rate

## Model Performance
- **Accuracy:** ~85%
- **Precision & Recall:** Optimized for medical predictions

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with a database for storing patient records.
- Deployment as a web-based application.
- Support for additional ML models.
